Welcome to the my page. I am a PhD student at the Barcelona Supercomputing
Center, working in the [Comparative Genomics lab](https://cgenomics.org/). My
research interests are focused on the evolutionary process and theory,
phylogenetic methodology and the evolution of gene families. Using all this
information I study the genomic changes in different drastic evolutionary
transitions (such as organellogenesis, eukaryogenesis, symbiosis, etc.)
across the eukaryotic tree of life.
