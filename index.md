Welcome to the my page. I am a MSc in Biostatistics student at the Universitat
de València also interested in Evolutionary Theory. Currently I am working at
the Evolutionary Genetics Laboratory at Institute for Integrative Systems
Biology, a joint institute between Universitat de València and the spanish
research council (CSIC).

My research interests are focused on the evolutionary process and theory,
phylogenetic methodology and the analysis of DNA and protein sequences. I use
all these methods and approaches to tackle the evolution of complexity problem,
that is how complexity has changed through the history of life. To manage this
data I develop some pipelines in order to improve the workflow in phylogenomics,
also looking into the inference and its underlying methods of phylogenetic
inference. I use both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference for the
inference of trees and parameters estimation, also I am introducing in the
Hidden Markov Models to structure and explain selection over a chain of traits,
nucleotides or proteins.

In parallel I study the evolution on early land plant and its selection
patterns. From a phylogenetic perspective we devise which molecular changes
have been playing a role in this great transition. At the research page you will
find all my research outputs and some materials are deposited in resources, for
any suggestion, collaboration or any data or software request contact me via
