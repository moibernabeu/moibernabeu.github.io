Welcome to the my page. I am a MSc in Biostatistics student at the Universitat
de Val√®ncia also interested in Evolutionary Theory. Currently I am working at
the Comparative Genomics Laboratory at Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-CNS).

My research interests are focused on the evolutionary process and theory,
phylogenetic methodology and the analysis of DNA and protein sequences. I use
all these methods and approaches to tackle the distribution of branch lengths
and its implication in crucial problems like the origin of eukaryotic cell.
To manage this data I develop some pipelines in order to improve the workflow
in phylogenomics, also looking into the inference and its underlying phylogenetic
methods. I use both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference for the topologies
and parameters estimation, also I am introducing in the Hidden Markov Models to
structure and explain selection over a chain of traits, nucleotides or proteins.

In parallel I study the evolution on early land plant and its selection
patterns. From a phylogenetic perspective we devise which molecular changes
have been playing a role in this great transition. At the research page you will
find all my research outputs and some materials are deposited in resources, for
any suggestion, collaboration or any data or software request contact me via
